# IS-211-Assignment3

For this assignemnt i have chosen to compare Dijkstras algorithm with a more brute force searching algorithm. These two algorithms are similar in structure but execute differently. Dijkstra will compare the nodes and look at the overall shortest path, whilst the brute force algorithm will look at what is currently its shortest path, and will choose the "easiest" answer.

I chose these two algorithms because it can give us insight in how similar algortihms can differ in runtime and precision. I chose the brute force algorithm after a lot of trial and error with the Lin-Kernighan algorithm. After spending a lot of time with it i realized I would not be able to finish the algorithm in time of the assignemnts due date. So i chose this one to be the comparison to Dijkstra. It is not the most optimal but it still gives room for analysis.

# Execution
Firstly to run this algorithm, all that is needed is to compile all java files and run the Main.java file.
