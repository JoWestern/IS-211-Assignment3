# IS-211-Assignment3

For this assignment I have chosen to compare Dijkstras algorithm with a more brute force searching algorithm. These two algorithms are similar in structure but execute differently. Dijkstra will compare the nodes and look at the overall shortest path, whilst the brute force algorithm will look at what is currently its shortest path, and will choose the "easiest" answer.

I chose these two algorithms because it can give us insight in how similar algortihms can differ in runtime and precision. I chose the brute force algorithm after a lot of trial and error with the Lin-Kernighan algorithm. After spending a lot of time with it I realized I would not be able to finish the algorithm in time of the assignemnts due date. So I chose this one to be the comparison to Dijkstra. It is not the most optimal but it still gives room for analysis.

In the code there are parts that are commented out which are remains from trying different probelms in the assignment.

# Execution
To run this program, all that is needed is to compile all java files and run the Main.java file.

Dijkstras algorithm can be found in Main.java and the Brute Force in BruteForce.java.

Side note:
Some cleanup is needed in the code.

# Conclusion
If we look at the overall speed, its easy to see that the Brute Force version finished in the fewest steps. It is looking at a signifacantly smaller amount of nodes and finds a solution faster, but the final length of the path is considerably longer than in Dijkstras algorithm. Looking at Dijkstras algorithm we see that the algorithm looks through every node on the map, and even after the destination is found it keeps searching. This runtime will become longer and longer the more nodes there are. From the other algorithms we have read about, the brute force differs a lot from algorithms such as the Lin-Kernighan, which finds multiple tours and comapres them. Which is much closer to what dijkstra does than the Brute Force algorithm. From what we can see in the tests, one can make out that speed and precision are the two trade offs when it comes to these algorithms.
